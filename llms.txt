# Pratejra Landing Page - AI Agent Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript landing page for Pratejra, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The project focuses on clean, modern UI with smooth animations and responsive design.

## Core Technologies
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- Lucide React for icons

## Project Structure
```

│   ├── layout/          # Shared layouts (Navbar, Footer)
│   ├── sections/        # Feature content sections

└── utils/             # Utility functions
```

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `HeroSection`, `ProjectsCarousel`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useCarouselAutoRotate`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatProject`)
- Files: PascalCase for components, camelCase for others

### Code Style
- 2-space indentation
- Arrow functions for event handlers
- Early returns over nested branches
- Use `clsx` or `class-variance-authority` for conditional classes
- Import from `src/constants` instead of duplicating literals

### Component Patterns
- Functional components with hooks
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Destructure props at component level
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Development Workflow

### Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes TypeScript check)
- `npm install` - Install dependencies

### Before Committing
1. Run `npm run build` to catch type errors
2. Test responsive design and interactions
3. Verify animations and state changes work correctly

### Commit Messages
- Short, imperative subjects (e.g., "Add hero animation", "Fix navbar mobile layout")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Component Guidelines

### Layout Components
- `Navbar`: Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- `Footer`: Site footer with links and branding

### Section Components
- `HeroSection`: Main landing hero with CTA
- `MissionObjectives`: Mission statement and goals
- `ProjectsCarousel`: Interactive project showcase
- `PhilosophySection`: Company philosophy
- `ImpactPulse`: Impact metrics visualization
- `AlliesCallToAction`: Partnership/collaboration section
- `ContactSection`: Contact form and information

### UI Components
- Use shadcn/ui components from `src/components/ui/`
- Customize with Tailwind classes
- Maintain design system consistency

## Styling Guidelines

### Tailwind Classes
- Use utility-first approach
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Custom animations via CSS classes in `src/styles/`
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's space scale

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)
- Test on multiple screen sizes

### Colors and Theming
- Define colors in `src/constants/`
- Use CSS custom properties for theme variables
- Maintain consistent color palette

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize images and assets
- Use lazy loading for heavy components
- Minimize bundle size
- Efficient re-renders with React.memo where appropriate

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Screen reader friendly

## File Organization
- Group related components in feature folders
- Keep utilities and hooks in dedicated directories
- Import from index files to maintain clean imports
- Avoid deep nesting in component structure

## Testing Approach
- Manual QA for now (no automated tests yet)
- Test all interactive elements
- Verify responsive behavior
- Check animation timing and smoothness
- Validate form submissions and state changes

## Deployment
- Built for Netlify deployment
- Static site generation
- Environment-specific configurations in `netlify.toml`

## Important Notes for AI Agents
- Always check existing code patterns before making changes
- Use the established component library (shadcn/ui) instead of creating new components
- Follow the existing file structure and naming conventions
- Test changes thoroughly before suggesting commits
- Reference the AGENTS.md file for additional project-specific guidelines
- When in doubt, ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
