# Completed Work

- **Refined existing Pratejra landing page** with modern best practices: ErrorBoundary, React.memo, lazy loading, accessibility improvements, bundle optimization
- **Built and enhanced single-file App.jsx** for "Project Shaivra" vision: monastic/militaristic design with grid-based layout, tables for data presentation, light/shadow toggle, using React, Lucide-React icons, and Tailwind CSS
- **Implemented structured content**: Header with status indicator, hero mantra, concept box, mission table, values grid, operational principles, footer incantation
- **Added interactions**: View toggle between Pratejra (Light) and Shaivra (Shadow), hover effects on grid cells, responsive design
- **Applied UI/UX improvements**: Spectral blue accents, glitch hover effects, standardized borders, font loading, accessibility features (ARIA, scope, captions), smooth transitions with Framer Motion, staggered animations
- **Committed phases**: Phase 1 (Core UI Polish), Phase 2 (UX Enhancements), Phase 3 (Advanced Interactions)

# Next Steps
